# Description
I love films! Watching films is one of my favourite hobbies and whenever I can, I like to just sit down and enjoy a good film.
And something I have always wanted to do was to keep track of which (and how many) films I have watched. And this is exactly the purpose of this app; you can search for films, see their details and add them to your watched films list or to your watchlist.

<br />

# Features

- Search for films
- See details of a film: directors, release date, genres, synopsis, runtime, etc
- Add films to your watched films list
- Add films to your watchlist
